# Mindful Watching Without Killing Engagement.
   * Redesign YouTube’s mobile viewing experience to discourage compulsive binge-watching—but in a way that doesn’t negatively affect engagement or retention. Your design should subtly influence user behavior through interface alone (no backend logic), preserving the 
     dopamine-driven flow of content consumption.

# Focus Areas:

* Micro-interactions that promote break-taking

* Visual rhythm cues tied to watch patterns

* Non-intrusive session/time reminders

* Subconscious nudges baked into layout
